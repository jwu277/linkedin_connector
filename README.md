# linkedin_connector
An automated LinkedIn connector. To get started, add a list of LinkedIn URLs to the `data/connections.txt` file. Then run the `main` method of `Main.java.`
Gecko Driver is needed which you can install with `> choco install selenium-gecko-driver` in Powershell on Windows. You will also need Firefox (or use `ChromeDriver` instead of `FirefoxDriver`).
